# Multi-Agent Semantic Knowledge Graph Framework for Explainable Alzheimer's Disease Detection Using Deep Learning and fMRI Neuroimaging

## Abstract

Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents one of the most pressing challenges in modern neurology, requiring sophisticated diagnostic tools that combine accuracy with clinical interpretability. This paper presents a novel multi-agent semantic knowledge graph framework that integrates deep learning models with neurobiological knowledge for explainable AD detection using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) **MCADNNet**, a specialized convolutional neural network architecture optimized for fMRI slice classification; (2) **CapsNet-RNN**, a hybrid capsule network with recurrent components for temporal fMRI sequence analysis; and (3) a **semantic knowledge graph system** that maps brain regions to functional networks and AD pathophysiology using Neo4j graph database. The framework employs a multi-agent pipeline comprising specialized agents for brain activation mapping, explainability analysis via GradCAM, knowledge graph reasoning, and clinical report generation. Experimental results on clinical fMRI datasets demonstrate superior performance with cross-validation accuracy exceeding 85%, while providing semantically grounded explanations linking brain activation patterns to established AD pathophysiology. The system successfully deploys on Google Cloud Platform using Vertex AI, enabling scalable clinical applications. This work advances the field by bridging the gap between black-box deep learning models and clinically interpretable AD diagnosis.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background and Motivation

Alzheimer's disease affects over 55 million people worldwide, making early and accurate diagnosis crucial for treatment planning and patient care. Traditional diagnostic approaches rely heavily on clinical assessments and structural neuroimaging, often detecting the disease only after significant neurological damage has occurred. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers the potential for earlier detection by capturing brain activity patterns associated with AD pathophysiology.

Despite advances in deep learning for medical imaging, current approaches suffer from two critical limitations: (1) **lack of interpretability** in clinical decision-making, and (2) **insufficient integration** of established neuroscientific knowledge about AD pathogenesis. These limitations hinder clinical adoption and trust in AI-assisted diagnosis.

### 1.2 Research Contributions

This work addresses these challenges through the following key contributions:

1. **Novel Deep Learning Architectures**: Introduction of MCADNNet and CapsNet-RNN models specifically designed for fMRI-based AD detection, incorporating domain-specific architectural innovations.

2. **Semantic Knowledge Graph Integration**: Development of a comprehensive knowledge graph system mapping brain regions to functional networks, cognitive functions, and AD pathophysiology using Neo4j graph database.

3. **Multi-Agent Explainable Framework**: Implementation of a multi-agent pipeline that provides semantically grounded explanations by combining deep learning predictions with neurobiological knowledge.

4. **Cloud-Native Deployment**: Full implementation on Google Cloud Platform using Vertex AI Agent Engines, demonstrating scalability for clinical deployment.

5. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Rigorous experimental validation using cross-validation on clinical fMRI datasets with multiple performance metrics.

### 1.3 Related Work

Recent advances in deep learning for neuroimaging have shown promising results for AD detection. However, most approaches focus solely on classification accuracy without addressing interpretability requirements crucial for clinical adoption. Knowledge graph applications in healthcare have demonstrated success in various domains, but integration with deep learning for neuroimaging remains underexplored.

Our approach uniquely combines these paradigms, providing both high accuracy and clinically meaningful explanations grounded in established neuroscience literature.

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 System Architecture Overview

The proposed framework consists of five main components working in a coordinated multi-agent architecture:

1. **Data Processing Pipeline**: Automated fMRI preprocessing and 2D slice extraction
2. **Deep Learning Models**: MCADNNet and CapsNet-RNN for classification
3. **Explainability Engine**: GradCAM-based activation analysis and brain region mapping
4. **Semantic Knowledge Graph**: Neo4j-based neurobiological knowledge representation
5. **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Google ADK-based agent coordination and report generation

### 2.2 Deep Learning Architectures

#### 2.2.1 MCADNNet Architecture

Our Multi-scale Convolutional Alzheimer's Disease Neural Network (MCADNNet) is specifically designed for fMRI slice classification:

```python
class MCADNNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes=2, input_shape=(1, 64, 64), dropout_p=0.5):
        super(MCADNNet, self).__init__()
        # Three-stage convolutional extraction
        self.conv0 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=1, out_channels=10, kernel_size=5, stride=1)
        self.pool0 = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2)
        
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=10, out_channels=20, kernel_size=5, stride=1)
        self.pool1 = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2)
        
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=20, out_channels=50, kernel_size=5, stride=1)
        self.pool2 = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2)
        
        # Adaptive fully-connected layers
        self._flatten_dim = self._get_flatten_dim(input_shape)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(in_features=self._flatten_dim, out_features=256)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(p=dropout_p)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(in_features=256, out_features=num_classes)
```

**Key innovations:**
- **Progressive feature extraction** with increasing channel depth (10→20→50)
- **Adaptive dimensionality calculation** for varying input sizes
- **Strategic dropout placement** after activation for optimal regularization
- **Optimized parameter count** (256 hidden units) balancing capacity and overfitting

#### 2.2.2 CapsNet-RNN Hybrid Architecture

For temporal fMRI sequence analysis, we developed a novel hybrid combining capsule networks with recurrent components:

```python
class CapsNetRNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.capsnet = CapsNet3D()  # 3D capsule feature extraction
        self.rnn = nn.RNN(input_size=32, hidden_size=64, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(64, 1)  # Final classification
```

**Key innovations:**
- **3D Capsule Layers** for spatial pattern recognition in brain volumes
- **Squash activation** preserving orientation information crucial for brain topology
- **Temporal RNN integration** capturing dynamic brain connectivity patterns
- **Multi-scale processing** from voxel-level to network-level representations

### 2.3 Semantic Knowledge Graph System

#### 2.3.1 Knowledge Graph Schema

Our knowledge graph represents neurobiological relationships using the following schema:

```
(Region)-[:HAS_FUNCTION]->(Function)
(Region)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(Network)
(Region)-[:ASSOCIATED_WITH]->(Disease)
(Network)-[:INVOLVED_IN]->(CognitiveProcess)
(Disease)-[:AFFECTS]->(CognitiveProcess)
```

#### 2.3.2 Brain Region Mapping

We integrate multiple neuroanatomical atlases:
- **AAL3 Atlas**: 166 anatomically defined brain regions
- **Yeo 7-Network**: Functional network assignments
- **AD Literature**: Disease-specific region associations

The mapping process transforms raw activation patterns into semantically meaningful region labels:

```python
def map_activation_to_regions(activation_map, atlas_labels):
    """Maps CNN activation patterns to anatomical brain regions"""
    region_activations = {}
    for region_id, region_name in atlas_labels.items():
        region_mask = (atlas_labels == region_id)
        region_activation = np.mean(activation_map[region_mask])
        region_activations[region_name] = region_activation
    return region_activations
```

### 2.4 Multi-Agent Framework

#### 2.4.1 Agent Architecture

The system employs a hierarchical multi-agent architecture using Google ADK:

1. **Root Agent**: Sequential pipeline coordinator
2. **Activation Mapping Agent**: Brain region localization from CNN activations
3. **Image Explanation Agent**: GradCAM-based visual explanation generation
4. **Graph RAG Agent**: Knowledge graph querying and reasoning
5. **Report Generation Agent**: Clinical report synthesis

```python
root_agent = SequentialAgent(
    name="fMRIAlzheimerPipeline",
    description="Multi-step neuroimaging analysis pipeline for AD detection",
    sub_agents=[
        map_act_brain_agent,
        ParallelAgent(sub_agents=[image_explain_agent, graph_rag_agent]),
        report_generator_agent,
    ],
)
```

#### 2.4.2 Explainability Pipeline

The explainability component combines multiple analysis streams:

1. **GradCAM Analysis**: Identifies discriminative image regions
2. **Activation Mapping**: Localizes activations to anatomical regions
3. **Knowledge Graph Querying**: Retrieves functional and pathological associations
4. **Semantic Integration**: Combines findings into coherent explanations

### 2.5 Training and Evaluation Protocol

1. **Slice Extraction**: 2D sagittal slices from 4D fMRI volumes
2. **Normalization**: Min-max scaling to [0,1] range
3. **Augmentation**: Spatial transformations preserving brain topology
4. **Cross-validation Split**: Stratified 5-fold subject-level partitioning
